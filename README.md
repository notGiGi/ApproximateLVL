## üìö About

ApproximateLVL is an advanced simulator for distributed computing agreement protocols. It provides an interactive visualization of how nodes in a distributed system converge to agreement despite unreliable message delivery.

The simulator explores the theoretical properties of two optimal algorithms - **Agreed Meeting Point (AMP)** and **Flip Value (FV)** - and demonstrates how their performance varies under different network reliability conditions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Real-time Simulation**: Watch Alice and Bob nodes converge through iterative message exchanges
- **üìä Dynamic Visualization**: Interactive charts showing convergence behavior over time
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Parameters**: Adjust message delivery probability, initial values, algorithm selection, and more
- **üìà Statistical Analysis**: Run multiple experiments to validate theoretical predictions
- **üìö Range Experiments**: Test algorithm performance across a probability spectrum
- **üíæ Experiment Storage**: Save, load, and compare different experiment configurations
- **üîç Detailed Analysis**: Data tables, histograms, and comparative visualizations

## üß† Theoretical Background

### The Agreement Problem

In distributed systems, nodes must often reach consensus despite unreliable communication channels. ApproximateLVL simulates a simplified version of this problem with two nodes (Alice and Bob) exchanging values over a lossy network with message delivery probability **p**.

### Optimal Algorithms

The simulator implements two theoretically optimal algorithms:

#### 1. Agreed Meeting Point (AMP)
- **When to use**: Optimal when p > 0.5
- **Behavior**: When a node receives a message, it adopts a predetermined meeting point value
- **Expected discrepancy**: 1-p
- **Properties**: Performs better with reliable networks

#### 2. Flip Value (FV)
- **When to use**: Optimal when p ‚â§ 0.5
- **Behavior**: When a node receives a message, it directly adopts the sender's value
- **Expected discrepancy**: (1-p)¬≤ + p¬≤
- **Properties**: More resilient to message loss in unreliable networks

## üîß Technical Details

### Simulation Engine

The core simulation engine implements:

```javascript
// Core simulation round logic
simulateRound: (aliceValue, bobValue, p, algorithm, meetingPoint) => {
  // Determine actual algorithm based on probability
  if (algorithm === "auto") {
    algorithm = p > 0.5 ? "AMP" : "FV";
  }
  
  // Simulate message delivery with probability p
  const aliceMessageDelivered = Math.random() < p;
  const bobMessageDelivered = Math.random() < p;
  
  // Update values based on algorithm
  let newAliceValue = aliceValue;
  let newBobValue = bobValue;
  
  if (bobMessageDelivered) {
    newAliceValue = algorithm === "AMP" ? meetingPoint : bobValue;
  }
  
  if (aliceMessageDelivered) {
    newBobValue = algorithm === "AMP" ? meetingPoint : aliceValue;
  }
  
  return {
    newAliceValue,
    newBobValue,
    aliceReceived: bobMessageDelivered,
    bobReceived: aliceMessageDelivered
  };
}
```

### Recent Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust validation of all data points prevents unexpected failures
- **Adaptive Simulation**: Automatically adjusts rounds based on proximity to critical probability thresholds
- **Performance Optimization**: Statistical validation through multiple repetitions
- **UI Resilience**: Graceful handling of incomplete or invalid data
